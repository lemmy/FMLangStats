# Query quarter datasets

WARNING: the above example run a query for two days, querying a full quarter consumes many GB from the (1000 GB) free query volume, only use if you are sure

```bash
# Fetch the Data for 2017/Q2 (months 4,5,6)
node query.js --tables "[githubarchive:month.201704], [githubarchive:month.201705], [githubarchive:month.201706]"
```
